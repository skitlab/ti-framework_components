 *  ======== Settings ========
 *  Global configuration settings for all Framework Components packages
 *
 *  This module provides high-level configuration settings for all
 *  Framework Components packages.
 *
 *  @a(Linking with Framework Components Libraries)
 *
 *  When linking an executable, this module's profile config param is
 *  used to select which libraries are used. See the {@link #profile}
 *  config param below. There are three typical use-cases.
 *
 *  1. Link with Framework Components libraries of a specific profile. Add the
 *  following to your application cfg script.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // set all framework component libraries to the given profile
 *  xdc.useModule('ti.sdo.fc.global.Settings').profile = "debug";
 *  @p
 *
 *  2. Link with Framework Component libraries using the program's profile. Add
 *  the following to your application cfg script.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // use the program's profile
 *  var Program = xdc.useModule('xdc.cfg.Program');
 *  xdc.useModule('ti.sdo.fc.global.Settings').profile = Program.build.profile;
 *  @p
 *
 *  3. Specify a profile on a per-package basis.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // specify the profile for some select packages
 *  xdc.loadPackage('ti.sdo.fc').profile = "debug";
 *  xdc.loadPackage('ti.sdo.fc.rman').profile = "debug";
 *  xdc.loadPackage('ti.sdo.fc.dman3').profile = "debug";
 *  xdc.loadPackage('ti.sdo.fc.edma3').profile = "debug";
 *  @p
 *
 *  Note that the third method above does not actually use the `profile`
 *  config param. It sets the package's profile config param directly.
 *
 *  The default value for the `profile` config param is `release`.
 *  Thus, even when building your executable using a debug profile, the
 *  Framework Component release libraries will be used. This helps to keep the
 *  executable size smaller when you want to debug the application code.

     *  named by this config param, then these libraries will be used
     *  when linking the final executable. Otherwise, a substitute
     *  library will be used. For example, if this config param is set to
     *  debug but there are only release libraries available, then the
     *  release library is used.
