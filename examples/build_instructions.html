<h2>Directory Conventions</h2>
<p><i>Important</i>: throughout the rest of this document, we will use the
following notation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt></b> - the root directory of your FC
  installation.  The FC packages are in the
  <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/packages</tt> directory (or repository); the
  original examples are in the <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/examples</tt>
  directory (or repository).</li>
  <li><b><tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt></b> - the root directory of your
  XDAIS installation.  Some distributions of this FC release include an
  <b>fctools</b> directory which contains an XDAIS release.  In the case of
  those distributions, <tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt> could be set to
  <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/fctools</tt>.  Note that the XDAIS packages will
  be located in the <tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/packages</tt> directory
  (or repository).</li>
  <li><b><tt>&lt;XDC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt></b> - the root directory of your
  XDC tools installation.  The FC examples now have a dependency on the XDC
  tools std.h header file. If you have installed DSP BIOS, you can set
  <tt>&lt;XDC_INSTALL_DIR&gt</tt> to <tt>&lt;BIOS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/xdctools</tt>.
  Otherwise, set <tt>&lt;XDC_INSTALL_DIR&gt</tt> to the root directory of your XDC
  tools installation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing to Build the Examples</h2>
<h3>Create a working directory</h3>
<p>
Create a working directory (e.g. <b>c:/myPackages</b>) and copy the
<b>examples</b> directory into it (e.g. <b>c:/myPackages/examples</b>).
This will be where you build and modify the Framework Components examples.
</p>
<p>
Doing this will ensure you have a backup copy of the original examples, as
provided by the Framework Components product.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Building examples under ti/sdo/fc/examples</h4> 
<!-- <h3>Build using XDC tools</h2> -->
<h3>1. Manage xdcpaths.mak and products.mak</h3>
<p>The Framework Components examples are provided with XDC build scripts.
<b>examples/xdcpaths.mak</b> is the Makefile include file used to define the targets and environment in which the example XDC packages will be built.
</p>
<p>At the root of the Examples directory, there is a <b>makefile</b> that will
need to be edited for your particular usecase. 
Edit the following variables described below
</p>

<h4>PROGRAMS</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the FC examples support different types of runtime
    environments (e.g. single processor, multiprocessor client/server).
  The <b>PROGRAMS</b> variable specifies which types of environments you
  want to build the examples for.
  Edit this variable to add/remove types of programs to build.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>DEVICE</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Different FC examples build for different devices.
  The <b>DEVICE</b> variable specifies the device you want to build
  your examples for. A comment above this variable will show the list of
  devices supported in this release.
  Edit this variable to add/remove devices for which to build the examples.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>MY_XDC_PATH</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Any other components required for modifications made to existing examples
   can be added via this variable.  (This is typically not used.)
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Dependencies</h3>
<p>Dependencies can be set in <b>$(FC_INSTALL_DIR)/products.mak</b>, which is 
then included by <b>examples/xdcpaths.mak</b>.</p>
<h4>INSTALL_DIR</h4>
<ul>
  <li> The many <b>INSTALL_DIR</b> variables let you set the path to other
  dependent components. Depending on the programs you are building and the
  devices you build for, you will need to set the path for one or more of
  these components.  If your distribution includes fctools/, you can set
  many of these variables to $(FC_INSTALL_DIR)/fctools.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Codegen Tools</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Correct code generation tool paths will need to be specified for the
  architectures you will be building for. For instance, to build for the C6472
  device, you will need to set the appropriate cgtools variables to the TI C64x
  toolchain location.<br />
  Note that for TI toolchains, this is the directory that contains bin/,
  include/, and lib/ subdirectories.<br />
  To disable the build for a given architecture for your device, ensure that
  the corresponding cgtools variables are undefined.  For example, to disable
  M3elf builds for the TI816X device, don't assign the M3 ELF cgtools variable.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Build examples</h3>
<p>
From the base of your examples directory, type</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>gmake clean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gmake</b></p>
This will build all the examples that are applicable for your <b>DEVICE</b> and
<b>PROGRAMS</b>.
Other make targets might also be available in the Makefile to build subsets of
the examples.

<h2>Building examples under ti/sdo/opencl</h4> 
<h3>1. Manage makefile</h3>
<p>Under individual examples in the ti/sdo/opencl directory, 
there is a <b>makefile</b> that will need to be edited for your particular usecase. 
Edit the following variables described below
</p>
<h3>2. Dependencies</h3>
<p>Dependencies can be set in <b>makefile</b>
<h4>INSTALL_DIR</h4>
<ul>
  <li> The many <b>INSTALL_DIR</b> variables let you set the path to other
  dependent components. Depending on the programs you are building and the
  devices you build for, you will need to set the path for one or more of
  these components.  If your distribution includes fctools/, you can set
  many of these variables to $(FC_INSTALL_DIR)/fctools.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Codegen Tools</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Correct code generation tool paths will need to be specified for the
  architectures you will be building for. For instance, to build for the C6472
  device, you will need to set the appropriate cgtools variables to the TI C64x
  toolchain location.<br />
  Note that for TI toolchains, this is the directory that contains bin/,
  include/, and lib/ subdirectories.<br />
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Build examples</h3>
<p>
In your specific example directory (for e.g., ti/sdo/opencl/examples/autoviz), 
type</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>gmake clean<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gmake</b></p>
This will build all the examples that are specified in the <b>makefile</b>
